# Smith & Crown Developer Test

This is a developer test that I've taken as a skills assessment for Smith & Crown.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Nodejs on your machine.

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installing

Installation is easy for this project. Simply clone the repo to your local machine. Navigate to the working folder in command line.

Run this command to install dependent node modules.

```
NPM install
```

Then, simply start the app.
```
NPM start
```

## Deployment

In order to deploy a live build, run...

```
NPM run-script build
```
Then, move the contents of the build folder output to the live server.
